On our scale, this happens instantaneously. It’s remarkable if you think about it. The brain can anticipate what will happen next, fill in the gaps, make thousands of computations in nanoseconds. &lt;em&gt;No wonder we want to replicate that process in computers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways we attempt to replicate, what we actually understand so little of, is with artificial neural networks (ANN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are made up of simple, highly interconnected elements called perceptrons. They’re mathematical models meant to imitate neurons in the human brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple inputs come in, the perceptron does some dynamic mathematical transformation, and outputs a value. In our brains, dendrites receive electrical signals and move them into the cell body. The nucleus computes and the axon carries the transformed signal out where it’s terminals neurotransmitter across the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a neural network, we can think of synapses as a connection between perceptrons, represented by a line from perceptron to perceptron. In the brain, synapses modulate the electrical signals in different amounts. We can replicate that by assigning an influence value to each synapse. Called weights, they represent the weight of influence each input has on our model’s decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weights combine with inputs to generate a weighted sum. This is the sum of inputs after being multiplied with each of their respective weights. Finally, a function is applied to the weight generating the final output. This function is supposed to replicate the threshold which regulates neuron firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can view the state of a neuron in terms of potential. There is the membrane potential, threshold potential, action potential, and resting potential. Each related to the distribution of electric charge within a neuron. Changes in distribution during the firing process are known as depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization. Electrophysiological recordings graph this process as a polynomial curve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the perceptron replicate the neuron as closely as possible, we have to apply a function to the weighted sum that can handle polynomials. These are called activation functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation functions are differentiable which means they can deal with polynomials and therefore, impose non-linearity onto the model. There are many functions to choose from but a common one is the Sigmoid function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have input values, weights, non-linear transformation, and output however, neural networks are used for deep &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt;. How does it &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; from these components?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning is an optimization problem.&lt;/strong&gt; We are trying to minimize the &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; in our prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we send test data through and it comes out on the other side with a prediction far from our target value. We need to determine the error, modify something to minimize the error, and then try again to get closer to the target value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would we be getting an error? We’ve weighted our inputs incorrectly, giving too much or too little influence to certain inputs. Therefore, minimizing the error is going to be related to changing the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our optimization problem is as follows, minimize the error by changing the weights. We can do this with an algorithm called Gradient Descent. It finds a local minimum of a differentiable function. This is why activation functions are so important.  If we had a network using a step function on the weighted sum, we’d only be able to generate 0 or 1 which won’t help us modify the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradient descent finds the derivative of the error with respect to each weight. Each differentiation gives us a new weight which will move us closer to a local minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue this process of differentiating and modifying weights until the prediction is the best approximation of the target value. &lt;strong&gt;This iterative process is the model learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a simple walkthrough of neural networks used in deep learning. If you want to see the math behind it and code that implements it, you can head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marissap/ANN/blob/master/ANN.ipynb&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; jupyter notebook. The key takeaway from this article is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective of a neural network is to find the value of each weight to produce predictions as close as possible to the target value.&lt;/p&gt;

I have consumed summaries and reflections by people that I respect and enjoyed the many incredible demos posted on twitter. I have formulated some thoughts, more like rough musings, on what GPT-3 means for the future of not just tech but the labour force and humanity. I think the many strands of thought can be summed up with right now we hold all the power. However, I don’t know how long that will last. We have a small opening to assert a direction on the future of AI. We must take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we hold all the power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my viewpoint, GPT-3 should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; scare us. It is an &lt;strong&gt;opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to lose your job to a robot and neither do I but, that doesn’t mean stopping progress. It means reimagining what work looks like, what productivity looks like, and what society looks like as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of humanity, new technologies, whether it be crop cultivation or the printing press, have made jobs obsolete. However, revolutionizing the way we work always ends up creating new jobs, ones we don’t even know about until the need arises. To take advantage of a technological revolution, we have to &lt;strong&gt;alter our thinking&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;get involved&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Our Thinking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of AI should be less focused on the elimination of jobs and more so on the organization of society. This includes the role of AI, the role of humans, the way they interact, and the structure of our days, among other things. To do this, we must optimize for the different ways of thinking. Humans and computers are not the same. I don’t believe the goal should be to make computers human. We should capitalize on the unique advantages computers have over humans instead of attempting to replicate humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are not good at mundane, repetitive tasks. Not only do we make a lot of mistakes, human errors, but it also stifles creativity. Process automation liberates humans from that type work so we can focus on tasks that require the uniqueness of the human thought process. Humans are good at interacting, building relationships, being attuned to the emotions and needs of their fellow person. We are also good at abstract thinking. These kinds of thinking are not linear. Computers, however, are best at linear thinking. By capitalizing on the strengths of both, we can achieve symbiotic computing; when AI supports humans and we work together to achieve goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems almost utopian to think of AI in this way. We are so used to hearing about the threats of AI instead of the potential it has in relation to society. Achieving a symbiotic digital society is about changing our way of thinking. We need to stop viewing technological progress as a threat and start viewing it as an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of thinking isn’t entirely on the individual. Without support and commitment from both the public and private spheres, we will always have doubt and fear. That is why developing AI in public is so key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New developments and ideas should be discussed openly, much like what OpenAI is doing by releasing papers and models into the public. To be honest, I don’t entirely know how to make this happen. Companies are incentivized to protect their intellectual property. If we can start to consider AI as a public good, like water or highways, that would allow us to develop in public. As it says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/charter/&quot;&gt;OpenAI’s charter&lt;/a&gt;—“our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think classifying AI as a public good requires us, the general public and especially tech workers, to demand and advocate for this way of thinking. If we don’t want our future to be decided for us, by those that currently hold a lot of knowledge, we have to be willing to spend time and energy advancing a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people out of work and robot overlords is not my idea of a pleasant future. A symbiosis between computers and humans is a matter of prioritization. Do we prioritize creativity or efficiency? Self-determination or coercion? Humans or profit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have the capacity to imagine a better alternative and then have the determination to achieve that vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big leaps forward in technology allow us, the chance, to make big leaps forward in many other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not let this opportunity slip by.&lt;/p&gt;

As companies announce permanent remote-first work or pivot their strategies to increase online engagement, I’ve watched with great interest the multitude of “hot takes” that have overtaken my twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck by an interesting juxtaposition: despite an explosion of voices calling to move more of our activity online, &lt;strong&gt;people keep showing us that they want in-person interactions&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to put forth my idea of a new type of communication or talk about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people are ignoring social distancing rules. In this post, I will outline what I see as a conflict between tech company’s view of human interaction and the general publics’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter and Shopify recently announced that they would be moving to a permanent remote-first strategy. Companies should absolutely be remote-friendly. Accessibility is something the tech industry is severely lacking in both product and culture. However, does this mean we put everything online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies are not just pivoting to remote work, they’re focusing on remote products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why go to your friend’s house for a movie night when you can stay in your own house and use Netflix Party? Why meet for coffee when you can hop onto Houseparty or Clubhouse? Why go for a hike when you can ride together on Peleton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech is the one industry where close physical proximity has consistently bred innovation. Google, Apple, Microsoft, and many others were started in a garage. Larry Page and Sergey Brin worked day and night, they were basically living together. Today, incubators litter San Francisco and like-minded people live in co-ops and houses together. The city itself is a textbook example of how people in close-proximity can create ideas and generate a pool of talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re constantly trying to monetize human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless we start charging people for going on a hike in a public park or for both coffee &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the table you sit at, it’s &lt;strong&gt;easier to monetize online&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The People&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of social interaction for healthy brain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315007795#bib77&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308644/&quot;&gt;development&lt;/a&gt;, physical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships&quot;&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and happiness cannot be overstated. So you may ask, is it possible to replicate this online? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no better test than the pandemic we are currently facing. In order to get the in-person human interaction we desire, people would have to risk contracting a lethal virus. Hoards of people are flocking to beaches, and even before the warm weather hit, they were finding ways to meet for walks or hang out in their friend’s basement. People desire human contact enough to risk contracting a deadly virus in exchange for one hour outside with an acquaintance. Think back to the videos that circulated in April of spring breakers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1240371160078000128&quot;&gt;“If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are social beings, and that doesn’t just mean hanging out with friends, it means we work, organize, exchange, create, and govern together. Can we replicate all those functions to the same degree of satisfaction and success that we do (or can do) in person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321000213X&quot;&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t think so either. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/1800307/why-person-socializing-mandatory-do-item&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent article talking about the importance of exchanging ideas and working physically together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I miss the most since the beginning of quarantine? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro-interactions that make me feel like part of the broader world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My daily visit to the coffee shop down the street. I can make coffee at home or I can use the Starbucks app to pre-order. But that has not fulfilled my desire. I miss my conversation with the barista who knows I like an extra hot Americano with no room. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to the grocery store. I can get groceries delivered but does it replicate walking around the store aimlessly or having an impulse for fresh pasta and heading over after work for a two-item purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatting with random people in lines. I compliment their tote bag, them my shirt. We smile and go our separate ways. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just in-person interaction, we also need the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a social species doesn’t just mean we desire gatherings like parties and festivals, it means that we also need the interaction we get &lt;strong&gt;every time we go out into the world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But doesn’t Gen Z live online?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/os_maris/status/1264661014718676995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that online connections are just as meaningful as in-person ones. I stand by this but my point in this post isn’t to claim that in-person interactions are more meaningful but that they are &lt;em&gt;preferred&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z lives online. I haven’t known a day without the internet. I spent a large chunk of my high school years snapchatting my friends in the same room as me. But what are we posting online? Photos of us sitting in our couch in the same sweatpants we wore to bed? Thoughts we had after spending all day indoors with our cat? No, photos of us &lt;em&gt;doing things&lt;/em&gt; and thoughts that were prompted from &lt;em&gt;talking to a random girl&lt;/em&gt; in the club bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crave experiences. We want memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facetiming my friends is meaningful but it’s not an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; and it’s not &lt;em&gt;postable&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

I’m still learning the language but I’d like to think I’m no longer a beginner. Just like applying skills from a degree to the workplace is different, so is applying self-learned skills. That’s why I wanted to take some time to share some of the ways my &lt;strong&gt;thinking shifted&lt;/strong&gt; once I started using Go in a professional environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Channels are king&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I viewed channels as a data transfer pipeline for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goroutines&lt;/code&gt;, allowing data to be written and read to. I was half right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels should be thought of as a communication tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels are about the transfer of information but not just data that you want to access in a different goroutine. It can be an alert. A channel, without a buffer, would only receive a message if there is an error thus notifying another goroutine that some part of the system/program has malfunctioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels are Go’s main synchronization mechanism. The standard library does have mutex for goroutine sync but channels are special. They block without explicit locks or condition variables. Synchronization and data transfer become one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. The standard library is enough&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Go, I’d primarily worked with Python and JavaScript. In these languages, most projects (right or wrong) have at least a few third-party dependencies. This isn’t the case with Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s standard library is very robust. Aside from APIs, which I’ll talk about next, everything can be done with the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so used to outsourcing certain parts of my projects instead of looking in the language first. Go is very opinionated, there aren’t a hundred variations to write something, so you’re forced into following best practices. This means, you’re less likely to farm out work and if you do, you can be pretty confident in its integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Integrating with APIs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many, a lot of my work is with systems running in the cloud. Talking to AWS, was my first exposure to Go and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned above, Go imposes/encourages a certain style without an actual style guide. Therefore, integrating with APIs is far more straightforward. You aren’t learning both the third-party system and their logic, just the system. The logic behind the APIs functions is so similar to yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. It’s all about concurrency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I truly grasped the importance of concurrency until I saw it applied in a distributed system. In my small project, concurrency wasn’t necessary but when you’re processing requests, making computations, and responding, concurrency is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first read, one might assume concurrency and parallel programming are similar or even the same. However, concurrency is a programming paradigm. Concurrent programs can run in parallel, but they don’t have too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main benefit of concurrent programs is their ability to break up executions into different, independent tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goroutines run in the same memory space so the key to making this concurrent system work is synchronization. There is a myriad of ways to control synchronization however, channels are primarily used. See above for more on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large system, functions heavily rely on shared data and when your system is distributed, managing access to that data is a challenge. Go helps make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
