Students found watching hours of online videos overwhelming and the videos to watch seemed to grow exponentially. We wanted to give students a way to manage their workload by breaking down large chunks of video into bite-sized pieces and allowing them to target concepts they find challenging. </p>\n<br>\n<p>For my undergrad thesis, myself and my fellow student, Tolu, worked to create a platform that provided a solution to students. The goal of this project was to create a platform that would make video lectures discoverable and searchable; helping users take better notes and search for key moments in lectures to improve their study process.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Problem</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Students struggle with maintaining focus and studying dense material during online classes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Solution</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A platform for students to navigate through video lectures easily and efficiently by making video content searchable and accessible in bite-size pieces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h4>Design &#x26; Development Principles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize User Experience</li>\n<li>Optimize the Backend</li>\n<li>Create Lasting Value</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Prioritizing the User</h4>\n<p>One of our main priorities through the development was user experience. That means we offloading all computational intensive work to the backend so the frontend was performative and responsive. It also means ensuring the user knows what is going on—processing large videos takes a lot of time and we never want the user to be unsure of what is happening.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should be clear to the user what is happening from upload to viewing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We added indicators throughout the UI that keeps users appraised of the backend processes. When a user uploads a video, a banner appears with a constantly updating progress bar on the upload status. Once a video has been uploaded to our backend, the processing starts, and users can see the status of their video (processing, processed, or failed) on another page in the UI. As for search, when a user searches a keyword, matching video slices and their accompanying transcripts are displayed together. In addition, the search query is highlighted within the transcript so it is clear to the user why this particular video slice was retrieved for them</p>\n<h4>Optimizing the Backend</h4>\n<p>Lecture videos are split into 5-minute slices. We made this choice for a number of reasons—to fit the goal of the platform and to optimize the backend. Simply transcribing a 90-minute lecture video and displaying it does not meet the goal of managing the overload of information students have to work through. Instead, we thought about simply scrolling to the timestamp in the video where the search keyword is first mentioned however, this creates a problem for the user experience. Seeking through a large video would likely create latency for the user as the video buffers. The transcript would also have to be scrolled to the correct place which means the frontend would have to pair transcription labels with the timestamp of the video which would again, add computational complexity to the UI. Going this route would have negatively impacted the user experience because heavy computation would be performed by the frontend which in turn, would decrease the performance of the website for the user. Transcribing and annotating a 90-minute lecture takes time, by breaking the video into 5-minute slices and processing them concurrently we speed that up.</p>\n<h4>Creating Lasting Value</h4>\n<p>Campuses are starting to open making the unique challenges of fully online learning are less of a concern. This is why we leaned into making Scribe a study tool not just a translator for online courses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Annotation of transcripts, exporting transcripts and notes, shareable links, saving videos to users’ personal library—these are just a few of the features in development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bite-size content is good but sometimes students want more context. To meet this need, we decided to give an option to the user to see the next or previous 5-minutes of the video. If they were missing context they deemed important, they can simply navigate through the video within the same UI screen. The way we structured the UI means the page is not reloaded when a new slice is requested but just the component holding the current video. This ensures that the other videos found with their search query are not lost.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scribe: Putting Control Back in the Hands of Students","date":"April 26, 2021","description":"Reflecting on my undergrad CS thesis.","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/scribe/","readingTime":"4 min read","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/intro-to-neural-networks/","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks"}},"next":null}}}
