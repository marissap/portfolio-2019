I have consumed summaries and reflections by people that I respect and enjoyed the many incredible demos posted on twitter. I have formulated some thoughts, more like rough musings, on what GPT-3 means for the future of not just tech but the labour force and humanity. I think the many strands of thought can be summed up with right now we hold all the power. However, I don’t know how long that will last. We have a small opening to assert a direction on the future of AI. We must take it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right now, we hold all the power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From my viewpoint, GPT-3 should <strong>not</strong> scare us. It is an <strong>opportunity</strong>.</p>\n<br>\n<p>You don’t want to lose your job to a robot and neither do I but, that doesn’t mean stopping progress. It means reimagining what work looks like, what productivity looks like, and what society looks like as well.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Since the beginning of humanity, new technologies, whether it be crop cultivation or the printing press, have made jobs obsolete. However, revolutionizing the way we work always ends up creating new jobs, ones we don’t even know about until the need arises. To take advantage of a technological revolution, we have to <strong>alter our thinking</strong> and <strong>get involved</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Our Thinking</h4>\n<p>The future of AI should be less focused on the elimination of jobs and more so on the organization of society. This includes the role of AI, the role of humans, the way they interact, and the structure of our days, among other things. To do this, we must optimize for the different ways of thinking. Humans and computers are not the same. I don’t believe the goal should be to make computers human. We should capitalize on the unique advantages computers have over humans instead of attempting to replicate humans.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Humans are not good at mundane, repetitive tasks. Not only do we make a lot of mistakes, human errors, but it also stifles creativity. Process automation liberates humans from that type work so we can focus on tasks that require the uniqueness of the human thought process. Humans are good at interacting, building relationships, being attuned to the emotions and needs of their fellow person. We are also good at abstract thinking. These kinds of thinking are not linear. Computers, however, are best at linear thinking. By capitalizing on the strengths of both, we can achieve symbiotic computing; when AI supports humans and we work together to achieve goals.</p>\n<br>\n<p>It seems almost utopian to think of AI in this way. We are so used to hearing about the threats of AI instead of the potential it has in relation to society. Achieving a symbiotic digital society is about changing our way of thinking. We need to stop viewing technological progress as a threat and start viewing it as an opportunity. </p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Get Involved</h4>\n<p>This way of thinking isn’t entirely on the individual. Without support and commitment from both the public and private spheres, we will always have doubt and fear. That is why developing AI in public is so key.</p>\n<br>\n<p>New developments and ideas should be discussed openly, much like what OpenAI is doing by releasing papers and models into the public. To be honest, I don’t entirely know how to make this happen. Companies are incentivized to protect their intellectual property. If we can start to consider AI as a public good, like water or highways, that would allow us to develop in public. As it says in <a href=\"https://openai.com/charter/\">OpenAI’s charter</a>—“our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.”</p>\n<br>\n<p>I do think classifying AI as a public good requires us, the general public and especially tech workers, to demand and advocate for this way of thinking. If we don’t want our future to be decided for us, by those that currently hold a lot of knowledge, we have to be willing to spend time and energy advancing a new approach.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Millions of people out of work and robot overlords is not my idea of a pleasant future. A symbiosis between computers and humans is a matter of prioritization. Do we prioritize creativity or efficiency? Self-determination or coercion? Humans or profit?</p>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have the capacity to imagine a better alternative and then have the determination to achieve that vision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<p>Big leaps forward in technology allow us, the chance, to make big leaps forward in many other areas.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We should not let this opportunity slip by.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>My favourite GPT-3 reads from people far more knowledgable than me:</p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/31/1005876/natural-language-processing-evaluation-ai-opinion\">The field of natural language processing is chasing the wrong goal</a> - Jesse Dunietz</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/everestpipkin/status/1284524605525446656\">Twitter thread</a> - Everest Pipkin @everestpipkin</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2020/07/gpt3-expectations/\">Tempering Expectations for GPT-3 and OpenAI’s API</a> - Max Woolf</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1283947769342963712\">Twitter thread</a> - Simon Sarris @simonsarris</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"This was not written by GPT-3","date":"August 13, 2020","description":"From my viewpoint, GPT-3 should not scare us.
