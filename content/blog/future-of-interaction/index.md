Like all of us, I've been spending a lot of time online during the coronavirus pandemic. As companies announce permanent remote-first work or pivot their strategies to increase online engagement, I've watched with great interest the multitude of "hot takes" that have overtaken my twitter feed.

<br>

I was struck by an interesting juxtaposition: despite an explosion of voices calling to move more of our activity online, **people keep showing us that they want in-person interactions**.  

<br>

I'm not here to put forth my idea of a new type of communication or talk about *why* people are ignoring social distancing rules. In this post, I will outline what I see as a conflict between tech company's view of human interaction and the general publics'.

#### Tech

Twitter and Shopify recently announced that they would be moving to a permanent remote-first strategy. Companies should absolutely be remote-friendly. Accessibility is something the tech industry is severely lacking in both product and culture. However, does this mean we put everything online?

<br>

Tech companies are not just pivoting to remote work, they're focusing on remote products. 

<br>

Why go to your friend's house for a movie night when you can stay in your own house and use Netflix Party? Why meet for coffee when you can hop onto Houseparty or Clubhouse? Why go for a hike when you can ride together on Peleton?

<br>

Tech is the one industry where close physical proximity has consistently bred innovation. Google, Apple, Microsoft, and many others were started in a garage. Larry Page and Sergey Brin worked day and night, they were basically living together. Today, incubators litter San Francisco and like-minded people live in co-ops and houses together. The city itself is a textbook example of how people in close-proximity can create ideas and generate a pool of talent.

> We're constantly trying to monetize human interaction.

Unless we start charging people for going on a hike in a public park or for both coffee *and* the table you sit at, it's **easier to monetize online**.


#### The People

The importance of social interaction for healthy brain [function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315007795#bib77), [development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308644/), physical [health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships) and happiness cannot be overstated. So you may ask, is it possible to replicate this online? 

<br>

There is no better test than the pandemic we are currently facing. In order to get the in-person human interaction we desire, people would have to risk contracting a lethal virus. Hoards of people are flocking to beaches, and even before the warm weather hit, they were finding ways to meet for walks or hang out in their friend's basement. People desire human contact enough to risk contracting a deadly virus in exchange for one hour outside with an acquaintance. Think back to the videos that circulated in April of spring breakers; ["If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I'm not gonna let it stop me from partying."](https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1240371160078000128)

<br>

Humans are social beings, and that doesn't just mean hanging out with friends, it means we work, organize, exchange, create, and govern together. Can we replicate all those functions to the same degree of satisfaction and success that we do (or can do) in person?

<br>

I don't think so and [science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321000213X) doesn't think so either. [Here](https://www.fastcompany.com/1800307/why-person-socializing-mandatory-do-item) is an excellent article talking about the importance of exchanging ideas and working physically together.

<br>

What do I miss the most since the beginning of quarantine? 

<br>

Micro-interactions that make me feel like part of the broader world. 

<br>

- My daily visit to the coffee shop down the street. I can make coffee at home or I can use the Starbucks app to pre-order. But that has not fulfilled my desire. I miss my conversation with the barista who knows I like an extra hot Americano with no room. 

- Going to the grocery store. I can get groceries delivered but does it replicate walking around the store aimlessly or having an impulse for fresh pasta and heading over after work for a two-item purchase.

- Chatting with random people in lines. I compliment their tote bag, them my shirt. We smile and go our separate ways. 

> It's not just in-person interaction, we also need the physical world.

Being a social species doesnâ€™t just mean we desire gatherings like parties and festivals, it means that we also need the interaction we get **every time we go out into the world**.

#### But doesn't Gen Z live online?

I recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/os_maris/status/1264661014718676995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) that online connections are just as meaningful as in-person ones. I stand by this but my point in this post isn't to claim that in-person interactions are more meaningful but that they are *preferred* and even *necessary*.

<br>

Gen Z lives online. I haven't known a day without the internet. I spent a large chunk of my high school years snapchatting my friends in the same room as me. But what are we posting online? Photos of us sitting in our couch in the same sweatpants we wore to bed? Thoughts we had after spending all day indoors with our cat? No, photos of us *doing things* and thoughts that were prompted from *talking to a random girl* in the club bathroom.

> We crave experiences. We want memories.

Facetiming my friends is meaningful but it's not an *experience* and it's not *postable*. 

<br>

A polaroid taken on some random person's camera in a dark club dressed in a sparkly wrap dress, that is **both**.

### Why are we pushing people online post-coronavirus when we so clearly desire in-person communication? Would Tech's time be better spent creating ways to make in-person communication more meaningful?
